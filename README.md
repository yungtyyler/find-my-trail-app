# Find My Trail web application
## By Tyler Varzeas
### In progress to become mobile application as well with back-end support

### Introduction

I have a couple of ideas for my project that I would love to develop and deploy as a fully functioning, “start-up” type of application. The first idea being a mobile game that tracks your movement throughout the day and gives your character experience points. When the character levels up, they can unlock certain features like maybe clothing accessories or backgrounds, or game modes. My other idea is more simplistic and probably realistic for the scope of this course. 

I plan to develop a website and mobile application for finding local hiking trails in the area and providing safety information on the trails. A database of the trails will be implemented and through user authentication, users will be able to create accounts and post reviews of the trails. This allows the end user to quickly find locations and plan effectively for new adventures, as well as share their thoughts and guidance about trails they have visited.


### What the MVP of your Project will Look Like:

My MVP for this course will be a static website that displays a home page for the site, an about page, and a contact page. A general hiking trail safety plan page will also be a good idea for this course to implement. When it comes to long-term project design, the MVP will also need to include user authentication, trail pages, review pages for each trail, and a user home page to display the trails they have reviewed themselves.

### Prioritized List of Extra Features:

Some additional features I would like to include are:
* Adding friends.
* Group-hiking experience: team up with other local hikers to adventure together.
* A level or tier system for users who hike and review often.
* Pictures section for users to add to on trail pages.

These features would allow for users to be more engaged with the application and have goals to strive towards. The friends and group hike features would also help build a sense of community amongst the users of the app. The pictures on the trail site might be the easiest to implement, therefore I will likely prioritize that feature above the others, followed by the friends list. Each of these extra features could be designed in the Bootstrap and React courses, however backend development of users will likely not be completed until the final course. By then however, it would be a good idea to have the pages designed and set up so that all that needs to be done is backend processes to make it come to life.

### Market Survey:

Sites that are similar in idea or concept to mine:
* All Trails
* Yelp
* Glassdoor
* Angie’s (Angie’s List)
* Redfin

All Trails is most similar to my idea. I was unaware of this website before thinking of it, and I have to admit it has a lot of the features I was hoping to implement, including reviews of trails, logging in, trail pages. However some ideas that I thought of that are not included include an emphasis on safety information and tips about each trail, user friends list, tier systems for users, and group hiking options.
